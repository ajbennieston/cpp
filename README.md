An open C++ course

Origins
-------
The contents of this repository began life as a set of notes produced after each of a series of five "hands-on" days that attempted to teach (some) C++ to first year postgraduate particle physics students. The notes originally addressed comments and questions from the day itself, as well as providing some additional material that was not present in the slides or conversation on the day.

Futures
-------
I intend to develop the material here to appeal to a wider audience, and to be independent of the original course. Over time, this may involve creating new sets of slides for the original five "hands-on" days, or the structure may change entirely. One goal is for the work I do here to be back-portable to the original course.

Current(s?)
-----------
At present, this is a work in progress. The first commit reflects the state of the material at the end of the 2011 run of the course, but subsequent commits fix various bugs, typos and other bad things. Over time, the changes should become more substantial.
